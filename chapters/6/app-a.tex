\subsection*{Case Study 1} 
According to a case presented in \cite{fatf-hawala}, a toy company in Los Angeles called Angel Toy Company engaged in structuring currency transactions while producing stuffed toys\footnote{See \cite{fatf-hawala}, Box 2.7 - Case 2, pp. 38}. Over the course of four years, investigators followed over \$8 million in cash deposits into the company's account, none of which were for more than \$10,000. The money was later returned to drug traffickers once the stuffed toys were exported and sold in foreign countries to generate "clean" money.

\subsection*{Case Study 2} 
An individual from Africa who lived in a European country admitted to conducting Hawala transactions, according to a report\footnote{See \cite{fatf-hawala}, Box 3.11, pp. 69}. The person's account received only cash deposits and small inward transfers. After a few months, the funds were transferred in bulk to Company A in Africa.
